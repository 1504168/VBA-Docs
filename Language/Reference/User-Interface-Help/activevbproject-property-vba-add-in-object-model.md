# ActiveVBProject property (VBA Add-In Object Model)

Returns the active [project](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project) in the [Project window](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#project-window). Read-only.

## Remarks

The **ActiveVBProject** property returns the project that is selected in the Project window or the project in which the components are selected. In the latter case, the project itself isn't necessarily selected. Whether or not the project is explicitly selected, there is always an active project.
