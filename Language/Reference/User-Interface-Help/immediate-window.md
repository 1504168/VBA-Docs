# Immediate window

![Immediate window](../../../images/immed_ZA01201615.gif)

Allows you to:

- Type or paste a line of code and press ENTER to run it.
    
- Copy and paste the code from the Immediate window into the Code window, but does not allow you to save code in the Immediate window.
    
The Immediate window can be dragged and positioned anywhere on your screen unless you have made it a dockable window from the **Docking** tab of the **Options** dialog box.

You can close the window by selecting the **Close** box. If the **Close** box is not visible, double-click the title bar to make the **Close** box visible, and then select it.

> [!NOTE] 
> In break mode, a statement in the Immediate window is executed in the context or [scope](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#scope) that is displayed in the **Procedure** box. For example, if you type **Print**_variablename_, your output is the value of a local variable. This is the same as if the **Print** method had occurred in the procedure you were executing when the program halted.
