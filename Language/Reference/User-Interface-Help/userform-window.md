# UserForm window 

![Userform window](../../../images/userform_ZA01201773.gif)

Allows you to create the windows or dialog boxes in your project. You draw and view [controls](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#control) on a [form](../../Glossary/vbe-glossary.md#form).

While you are designing a form:

- Each form window has a **Maximize**, **Minimize**, and **Close** button.
    
- You can view the form grid and determine the size of the gridlines from the **General** tab of the **Options** dialog box.
    
- Use the buttons in the Toolbox to draw controls on the form. You can set your controls to align with the grid of your form from the **General** tab of the **Options** dialog box.
